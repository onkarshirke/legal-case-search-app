## 💻 Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS (or Chakra/UIKit)
* **Backend**: Node.js + Express or Next.js API Routes
* **AI Retrieval**: LangChain, OpenAI GPT
* **Vector Database**: Pinecone
* **Hosting / Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend), Vercel Serverless / AWS Lambda (Backend)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v16+ recommended)
* Yarn or npm
* Pinecone account and index
* OpenAI (or equivalent) API key

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onkarshirke/legal-case-search-app.git
cd legal-case-search-app
npm install  # or yarn install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file at the root:

```dotenv
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-pinecone-api-key
PINECONE_INDEX=your-index-name
VOYAGE_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
# PORT is ignored on Vercel (automatically assigned)
```

> ❗ **Note**: Do not wrap values in quotes—Vercel and `.env` parsers interpret them literally.

### Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to explore the app.
